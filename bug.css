The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can cause unexpected issues if used improperly with units or if there are missing spaces around operators.  For example, `width: calc(100%-10px);` is correct, but `width:calc(100%-10px);` (missing space before the minus) will fail.  Another common issue is inconsistent use of units within the calculation â€“ ensure all units are consistent (e.g., pixels or percentages).
