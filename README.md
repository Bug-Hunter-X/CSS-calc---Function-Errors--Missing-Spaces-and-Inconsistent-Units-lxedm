# CSS calc() Function Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS:  incorrect spacing and inconsistent units within the calculation.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**  The `calc()` function requires careful attention to spacing and unit consistency. Missing spaces around operators or mixing units can lead to unexpected layout results or CSS parsing errors.

**Solution:**  Ensure there are spaces before and after each operator within the `calc()` function, and use consistent units throughout the calculation.

See the CSS files for detailed examples.
